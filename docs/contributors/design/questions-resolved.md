# Resolved questions

History of design/implementation questions that have been answered. Items are moved here
from [`questions-unresolved.md`](questions-unresolved.md) once resolved, so the active file
stays a working set. Newest first.

103. ~~**What does "idle" mean without an agent?**~~ — **Resolved (D84, 2026-06-14):** It doesn't. The substrate owns *liveness* only — `State ∈ {Provisioned, Running, Suspended, Stopped}`. `Active`/`Idle`/`Done`/`Failed` are the **agent layer** interpreting `State` + a process's `ExitStatus` + the monitor (Done/Failed = relabel of exit 0/non-zero; Active vs Idle = the one thing only an agent-watcher can know). A launched process's exit is a per-process fact (`Process.Wait`), not substrate state. There is no middle "supervision" tier — "supervision" is caller policy over substrate mechanism, not a layer. See [substrate-interface.md](substrate-interface.md) §3 / [D84](../decisions/working-notes.md).

106. ~~**The `sandbox` noun**~~ — **Resolved (D84, 2026-06-14):** No collision after all. The substrate handle is named **`Substrate`**; the agent-aware product handle stays **`yoloai.Sandbox`** — different names at different layers. The freed `sandbox` noun is *not* claimed by the substrate layer. See [substrate-interface.md](substrate-interface.md) / [D84](../decisions/working-notes.md).

1. ~~**Go module path**~~ — **Resolved:** `github.com/kstenerud/yoloai`.

2. ~~**Node.js version**~~ — **Resolved:** Node.js 22 LTS via NodeSource. Claude Code's `engines` field requires `>=18.0.0`; Node 22 is well within range. Node 20 LTS reaches EOL April 2026 — Node 22 LTS (maintenance until April 2027) avoids shipping with an EOL runtime. Anthropic's devcontainer still uses Node 20 as of February 2026, but no Node 22-specific incompatibilities have been found. The native Claude Code installer (curl script) is not suitable: bundles Bun with broken proxy support (issue #14165), segfaults on Debian bookworm AMD64 (#12044), and auto-updates. npm install shows a deprecation warning but remains the only reliable path for Docker/proxy use. See [Implementation Research](research/implementation.md) "Claude Code Installation Research".

3. ~~**tini**~~ — **Resolved:** Use `docker run --init` (Docker's built-in tini). Simpler than installing in image. We control all container creation in code so the flag is always passed.

4. ~~**gosu**~~ — **Resolved:** Install from GitHub releases (static binary). Standard for Debian images.

5. ~~**Claude ready indicator**~~ — **Resolved:** Fixed 3-second delay for MVP, configurable via `config.json` `startup_delay`. Polling deferred.

6. ~~**Caret encoding scope**~~ — **Resolved:** Implement the full caret encoding spec. Trivial to implement and avoids platform-specific assumptions.

7. ~~**`--model` flag**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Trivial pass-through to agent command.

8. ~~**`yoloai exec`**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Simple `docker exec` wrapper, useful for debugging.

9. ~~**Dangerous directory detection**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Small validation function.

10. ~~**Dirty git repo warning**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Small git status check.

15. ~~**Entrypoint configuration passing**~~ — **Resolved:** Bind-mounted JSON config file at `/yoloai/config.json`. Entrypoint reads all configuration from it — agent command, startup delay, UID/GID, submit sequence, and later overlay mounts, iptables rules, setup commands. Single source of truth from the start; no env vars.

16. ~~**`setup` commands — execution mechanism**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Setup commands written to a bind-mounted script, executed by entrypoint before launching agent.

17. ~~**tmux behavior when agent exits**~~ — **Resolved:** `remain-on-exit on` — container stays up after agent exits. User can still attach and see final output. Container only stops on explicit `yoloai stop`/`destroy`.

18. ~~**Context file content and delivery**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Context file generated on host, bind-mounted read-only. Claude gets it via `--append-system-prompt`, Codex via prompt prepend.

19. ~~**Untracked files in diff/apply**~~ — **Resolved:** `git add -A` before diffing to capture untracked files. Runs in the sandbox copy, not the user's original.

20. ~~**Multiple `:copy` directories in diff/apply**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP (MVP has single workdir, no aux dirs). Show all with headers per directory. Apply all at once with single confirmation. If one fails, stop and report which failed. User can re-run with `[-- <path>...]` to apply selectively.

21. ~~**Overlay apply — patch transfer to host**~~ — **Resolved:** Capture `git diff` output from `docker exec` stdout, pipe to `git apply` on host. No temp file needed.

22. ~~**`agent_files` — scope**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Two forms: string (base directory — yoloai appends the agent's state subdir, e.g. `"${HOME}"` → `~/.claude/` for Claude) or list (specific files/dirs to copy verbatim). Excludes session history and caches. If source doesn't exist, skip silently. Runtime state tracked in `state.json` (alongside `meta.json`).

23. ~~**`agent_files` — "first run" detection**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. `state.json` is created at sandbox creation time alongside `meta.json`. It contains an `agent_files_initialized` boolean (initially `false`). After `agent_files` seeding completes, the field is set to `true`. To re-seed, set the field back to `false` and restart the sandbox.

24. ~~**How does the binary find Dockerfile and entrypoint at runtime?**~~ — **Resolved:** `go:embed` bundles defaults. On first run, seed `~/.yoloai/Dockerfile.base` and `entrypoint.sh` if they don't exist. Build always reads from `~/.yoloai/`, not embedded copies. User can edit for fast iteration.

25. ~~**Codex binary download URL and versioning**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP (Codex deferred). Pin version in Dockerfile when implemented.

26. ~~**`yoloai build --secret` — which secrets are automatically provided?**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Auto-provide `~/.npmrc` if it exists. No other automatic secrets. Additional secrets via `--secret` flag.

27. ~~**Docker network naming and lifecycle**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Per-sandbox network: `yoloai-<name>-net`. Created during `yoloai new --network-isolated`, destroyed during `yoloai destroy`.

28. ~~**Proxy allowlist file format**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. One domain per line, `#` comments. Bind-mounted file in proxy container.

29. ~~**Proxy Go source location**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. `cmd/proxy/main.go` — separate binary in its own container, belongs in `cmd/`.

30. ~~**`yoloai start` when container was removed**~~ — **Resolved:** Re-run full container creation logic from `meta.json`, skip copy step. Credential injection: create new temp file each time (ephemeral by design).

31. ~~**`yoloai list` STATUS "exited" detection**~~ — **Resolved:** `docker exec tmux list-panes -t main -F '#{pane_dead}'`. Combined with Docker container state gives: running, exited, stopped, removed.

32. ~~**Dangerous directory list**~~ — **Resolved:** `$HOME`, `/`, plus platform-specific: macOS (`/System`, `/Library`, `/Applications`), Linux (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/boot`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`). Simple string match on absolute path — no subdirectory blocking.

33. ~~**`yoloai diff` for `:rw` — why docker exec?**~~ — **Resolved:** `:rw` runs `git diff` directly on host (bind mount = same files). Docker exec only needed for overlay.

34. ~~**No workdir and no profile**~~ — **Resolved:** Error: "no workdir specified and no default workdir in profile" (exit 2). Workdir required for MVP.

35. ~~**`auto_commit_interval` implementation**~~ — **Resolved:** Post-MVP. Shell script loop spawned by entrypoint. `git add -A && git commit` with author `yoloai <yoloai@localhost>`, UTC timestamp message. Skips if no changes. Creates commit history that `yoloai apply` preserves as individual commits (see #86).

36. ~~**Profile without a Dockerfile**~~ — **Resolved (revised):** Dockerfile is optional per profile. Profiles without a Dockerfile use `yoloai-base` directly — no image build needed. This is simpler for runtime-only profiles (env, ports, directories) that don't need custom packages. If a profile explicitly depends on `yoloai-base`, base image updates affecting all dependents is expected and correct behavior. The earlier "always seed a Dockerfile" approach added unnecessary maintenance burden for the common case.

40. ~~**Image cleanup mechanism**~~ — **Resolved.** `yoloai system prune` now removes dangling Docker images (stale build layers from image rebuilds) in addition to orphaned containers, VMs, and temp files. Uses Docker's `dangling=true` filter, which only removes unreferenced images — safe for running sandboxes.

41. ~~**`.:copy` boilerplate**~~ — **Resolved:** Workdir defaults to `:copy` (the tool's core philosophy). `yoloai new fix-bug .` works. `:rw` requires explicit suffix. Safe default preserved.

42. ~~**Implicit workdir from cwd**~~ — **Resolved (firm decision — do not revisit):** Keep workdir explicit (`.` required). One character is low friction and avoids accidental sandboxing of wrong directory. This is a deliberate safety choice: implicit cwd defaulting is a footgun that leads to sandboxing the wrong directory. This has been discussed multiple times and the decision is final.

43. ~~**Sandbox name repetition**~~ — **Resolved:** Shell completion via `yoloai completion` (Cobra built-in) in MVP. `YOLOAI_SANDBOX` env var as fallback when name arg is omitted — explicit arg always wins. No special `yoloai use` command; users just `export YOLOAI_SANDBOX=fix-bug`.

44. ~~**No `--prompt-file` or stdin**~~ — **Resolved:** Add `--prompt-file <path>`. Both `--prompt -` and `--prompt-file -` read from stdin.

45. ~~**No reset/retry workflow**~~ — **Resolved:** Add `yoloai reset <name>` — re-copies workdir from original, resets git baseline, keeps sandbox config and agent-state.

46. ~~**First-time setup friction**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai new` auto-detects missing setup: creates `~/.yoloai/` if absent, builds base image if missing. `yoloai init` dropped. `yoloai new --no-start` for setup-only (create sandbox without starting container).

47. ~~**No default profile**~~ — **Resolved:** Add `defaults.profile` to config.yaml. CLI `--profile` overrides. `--no-profile` to explicitly use base image.

48. ~~**`yoloai diff` no summary mode**~~ — **Resolved:** Add `--stat` flag (passes through to `git diff --stat`).

49. ~~**`yoloai apply` all-or-nothing**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai apply <name> [-- <path>...]` to apply specific files only.

50. ~~**Shell completion setup**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai completion` command in MVP. Print setup instructions after first-run auto-setup during `yoloai new`.

51. **"Is it done?" check** — **Resolved (revised):** originally deferred ("hard to detect agent idle vs working"). Since superseded — agent status detection (active/idle/done/failed/stopped) now ships and drives `yoloai ls` filtering, so "is it done?" is answered directly.

53. ~~**No read-only/investigation mode shortcut**~~ — **Resolved:** Not a problem. `:copy` with overlay is instant. Agent needs write access even for investigation. No change needed.

54. ~~**`yoloai reset` does not re-send the prompt**~~ — **Resolved:** Reset re-sends the original `prompt.txt` by default. `--no-prompt` flag to suppress.

57. ~~**No indication of agent completion vs. crash**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai list` shows "done" (exit 0) vs "failed" (non-zero) using tmux `pane_dead_status`. Not just "exited."

58. ~~**`yoloai list` doesn't show unapplied changes**~~ — **Resolved.** CHANGES column added using `git status --porcelain` on host-side work directory — lightweight (read-only, short-circuits), catches both tracked modifications and untracked files, no Docker needed.

59. ~~**Multiple sandbox conflict detection is absent**~~ — **Resolved:** Include better error messaging — wrap `git apply` failures with context explaining why the patch failed. Predictive conflict detection deferred.

60. ~~**No bulk destroy or stop**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai destroy name1 name2 name3` with single confirmation, plus `--all` flag. Same for `yoloai stop`.

61. ~~**First-time base image build is slow and poorly communicated**~~ — **Resolved:** Clear "Building base image (first run only, ~2-5 minutes)..." message during auto-build on first `yoloai new`.

62. ~~**`yoloai log` has no tail or search**~~ — **Resolved:** ~~No `--tail`, no pager. Raw stdout output. User composes with unix tools.~~ Superseded by #76: auto-page through `$PAGER` / `less -R` when stdout is a TTY.

63. ~~**No way to see what prompt was given to a sandbox**~~ — **Resolved:** Include `yoloai show <name>` in MVP. Displays all sandbox details: name, status, agent, profile, prompt, workdir (resolved path), creation time, baseline SHA, container ID. Essential for dogfooding/debugging.

64. ~~**`YOLOAI_SANDBOX` is awkward for multi-sandbox workflows**~~ — **Resolved:** Documentation only. Document `YOLOAI_SANDBOX` as "useful for single-sandbox sessions" rather than general convenience.

65. ~~**`yoloai apply` on overlay requires container running**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai apply` auto-starts the container when needed for overlay diff. No user action required.

66. ~~**No `yoloai new --replace` for iterate-and-retry**~~ — **Resolved:** Include `--replace` flag on `yoloai new`. Destroys existing sandbox of the same name and creates fresh.

67. ~~**`yoloai reset` preserves agent-state, which may work against the user**~~ — **Resolved:** Include `--clean` flag on `yoloai reset` to wipe agent-state for a truly fresh start.

68. ~~**Workdir `.` has no confirmation of resolved path**~~ — **Resolved:** Already covered by existing creation output format showing resolved absolute path. No design change needed.

70. ~~**No `yoloai diff` safety note while agent is running**~~ — **Resolved:** Print warning "Note: agent is still running; diff may be incomplete" when tmux pane is alive during `yoloai diff`.

71. ~~**No way to inspect profile configuration**~~ — **Resolved.** Implemented as `yoloai profile info <name>`. Shows merged config with full inheritance chain. Supports `--json` and `base` profile.

73. ~~**`yoloai destroy` confirms even when unnecessary**~~ — **Resolved:** Smart destroy confirmation — skip prompt when sandbox is stopped/exited with no unapplied changes. Only confirm when agent is running or unapplied changes exist.

74. ~~**No warning when `:rw` workdir overlaps with existing sandbox**~~ — **Resolved:** Error at creation time on path prefix overlap between any sandbox mounts — `:rw`/`:rw`, `:rw`/`:copy`, `:copy`/`:copy`. Check: does either resolved path start with the other? `:force` suffix overrides with a warning (same mechanism as dangerous directory detection). Error by default, `:force` is the explicit escape hatch.

76. ~~**`yoloai diff` and `yoloai log` should auto-page when stdout is a TTY**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai diff` and `yoloai log` should auto-page through `$PAGER` / `less -R` when stdout is a TTY, matching `git diff`/`git log` behavior. Piping (`yoloai diff my-task | less`) already works since both output raw to stdout; auto-paging is the polished default.

79. ~~**`yoloai apply` auto-starting container for overlay should print a message**~~ — **Resolved:** Print "Starting container for overlay diff..." to stderr when auto-starting a stopped container during `yoloai apply`. Consistent with standards/CLI.md progress-on-stderr convention.

80. ~~**Cannot add `--port` after sandbox creation**~~ — **Resolved:** Docker limitation — port mappings cannot be added to running containers. Document in `--port` help text: "Ports must be specified at creation time. To add ports later, use `yoloai new --replace`." No code change, just documentation.

81. ~~**`:rw` diff shows all uncommitted changes, not just agent changes**~~ — **Resolved:** Inherent to `:rw` mode — `git diff` runs against HEAD on the live directory, so pre-existing uncommitted changes are mixed with agent changes. Document in `yoloai diff` help: "For `:rw` directories, diff shows all uncommitted changes relative to HEAD, not just agent changes. Use `:copy` mode for clean agent-only diffs."

82. ~~**Post-creation output should adapt to whether `--prompt` was given**~~ — **Resolved:** Context-aware next-command suggestions after `yoloai new`: without `--prompt`, suggest `yoloai attach <name>` (agent is waiting for input); with `--prompt`, suggest `yoloai attach <name>` to interact and `yoloai diff <name>` when done.

83. ~~**`yoloai new` output should show resolved configuration**~~ — **Resolved:** Creation output shows a brief summary of resolved settings: agent, profile (or "base"), workdir path + mode, copy strategy, network mode. Confirms what was actually configured when options come from defaults + profile + CLI.

84. ~~**`show` and `status` commands overlap**~~ — **Resolved:** Merge into single `yoloai show` command. `show` now includes directories with access modes (from `status`). `status` removed from command table.

85. ~~**Entrypoint JSON parsing**~~ — **Resolved:** Install `jq` in the base image. The entrypoint reads `/yoloai/config.json` via `jq` for all configuration (agent_command, startup_delay, submit_sequence, host_uid, host_gid, etc.). Simpler and more robust than shell-only JSON parsing.

86. ~~**Commit-preserving apply**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai apply` preserves individual commits by default using `git format-patch` + `git am --3way`. Defaults to **commits only**; uncommitted (WIP) changes are reported via a hint but not applied. Opt in to applying WIP as unstaged modifications with `--include-wip`. `--squash` flattens into a single unstaged patch (commits only unless `--include-wip` is also set). `--patches <dir>` exports `.patch` files for manual curation; writes `wip.diff` only with `--include-wip`. See [commands.md](../design/commands.md) `yoloai apply` section and the WIP semantics flip in [BREAKING-CHANGES.md](../../BREAKING-CHANGES.md).

86. ~~**Agent CLI arg passthrough**~~ — **Resolved:** `yoloai new fix-bug . -- --max-turns 5` passes everything after `--` verbatim to the agent command. Passthrough args are appended after yoloai's built-in flags (e.g., `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --model claude-opus-4-latest --max-turns 5`). Duplicating first-class flags in passthrough is undefined behavior (depends on agent's CLI parser). Standard `--` convention (npm, docker, cargo). High value for dogfooding — agents have many flags yoloai doesn't need to wrap.

87. ~~**Extension shell script security**~~ — **Resolved.** Initial release: documentation only (warn users to review scripts, same trust model as Makefiles). Follow-up: review-on-first-run — display action script and prompt for confirmation on first execution or after modification (track script hash to detect changes).

88. ~~**Extension discovery and sharing**~~ — **Resolved.** Manual file copying — users share YAML files via gists, repos, blog posts. Format is already self-contained. `--install <url>` and curated repos are future enhancements if demand exists.

89. ~~**Agent-agnostic extensions**~~ — **Resolved.** Shell branching on `$agent` is sufficient — no structured per-agent action sections. For very different agents, create separate extension files. The `agent` field accepts a string or list: `agent: claude`, `agent: [claude, codex]`. Omit `agent` entirely for any-agent compatibility. yoloAI validates the current agent against the list before running the action.

90. ~~**Extension arg validation**~~ — **Resolved.** No type validation — all args and flags are passed as strings. Errors surface naturally from the commands in the action script (e.g., `yoloai new` errors on nonexistent workdir). Keeps the YAML simple and doesn't limit what extensions can do.

91. ~~**Worktree source directories — .git file link is unsafe after copy**~~ — **Resolved (Phase 4b bugfix).** When the source directory is a git worktree, `.git` is a file (not a directory) containing a `gitdir:` pointer back to the main repo. After `cp -rp`, the copy's `.git` file still points to the original repo's object store — git operations in the container would affect the host repo. Fix: `gitBaseline` now uses `os.Lstat` to detect `.git` files, removes the worktree link, and creates a fresh standalone baseline via `git init`. The baseline SHA is different from the original HEAD but that's correct — diff/apply only need a baseline representing the copy's initial state.

93. **MCP server support inside containers** — **RESOLVED 2026-05-27.** Two halves to the original question:
    - **Architectural concern** (the OQ-tracked half): "did the rearchitecture leave a `docker exec`-style leak in `internal/mcpsrv/proxy.go`?" Verified resolved — `proxy.go:240` now calls `p.c.StdioExec(...)` via the runtime-abstracted Client API, no backend-specific shell-out. W-L8b landed this. Open-question status retired.
    - **Feature gap** (the deferred half): stdio MCP servers need their binaries baked into the sandbox image, and network MCP servers' `localhost` references resolve to the sandbox, not the host. Today: users with MCP-heavy workflows build a custom profile that installs the binaries and rewrites references to `BackendDescriptor.HostFromContainer`. Open-ended future work — detection + warnings, auto-rewrites, or an `mcp install` helper — tracked in [docs/contributors/design/plans/README.md](plans/README.md) "MCP servers don't fully work inside sandboxes". No further OPEN_QUESTIONS status needed.

95. ~~**Profile inheritance model**~~ — **Resolved.** Profiles specify `extends: <profile-name>` (defaults to `base` if omitted). Config merge chain: base config.yaml → each profile in extends order → CLI flags. Image chain: each profile with a Dockerfile builds `yoloai-<name>` FROM its parent's image. Profiles without Dockerfiles inherit their parent's resolved image. Cycle detection on the extends chain (error on revisit). Implemented in `internal/sandbox/profile.go`.

97. **Comprehensive network allowlist audit for all agents** — **RESOLVED 2026-05-27.** The architectural concern (does the rearchitecture affect allowlist *shape*?) was answered "no" at deferral time — allowlists are per-agent values, not Client API surface. The remaining work — capturing actual network traffic during full sessions per agent and adding any missing domains — is empirical data work, not an open architectural question. Tracked in [docs/contributors/design/plans/README.md](plans/README.md) "Comprehensive network allowlist audit". Re-elevate to OPEN_QUESTIONS only if a missing-domain class is found that suggests a structural fix (e.g. a runtime DNS-passthrough mechanism) rather than just adding more domain strings.

99. ~~**Reference files pollute diff/apply workflow**~~ — **Resolved.** Bidirectional file exchange directory: `~/.yoloai/sandboxes/<name>/files/` on host, mounted rw at `/yoloai/files/` in sandbox. Managed via `yoloai files` subcommands (`put`, `get`, `ls`, `rm`, `path`). Lives outside the work dir so it never appears in diff/apply. Works across all backends (Docker bind mount, Tart VirtioFS, Seatbelt SBPL sandbox dir rule). See [commands.md](../design/commands.md) for full spec.

100. ~~**Dual command dispatch (verb-first vs name-first)**~~ — **Resolved 2026-05-23: keep both.** Per [D9](../archive/design/layering.md#7-decisions): both paths pass an explicit sandbox name to the same Client method, so dispatch shape is a presentation-layer concern (extra test surface), not a Client API shape concern. Deprecation deferred indefinitely; revisit if usage data ever materializes. Add a test in W-L10's enforcement that every Client-backed command works through both dispatch paths.

101. ~~**`yoloai.Client` public API fate**~~ — **Resolved 2026-05-23: keep `yoloai.Client` as the CLI's spine (internal-grade); declare external-stable only when a consumer materializes.** Per [D3](../archive/design/layering.md#7-decisions) and [layering.md §6](../archive/design/layering.md#6-public-api-stabilitydecoupled). The original framing ("does an external consumer exist?") was wrong — the question is "is the CLI a thin shell over the Client?", and the layering refactor makes the answer yes. External stability is deferred until a real consumer (MCP server, HTTP wrapper, library use) materializes.

102. **`sandbox/setup_test.go` is 632 lines — justified or split?** — **RESOLVED 2026-05-27.** Revisited post-rearchitecture: file is now 330 lines (W-L3 / W-L8b's factoring of ApplySetup dropped the original 632-line measurement). Read `setup.go` (352 lines) and `setup_test.go` together; the test length is the cross product of the state machine's real branches (3 platforms × 4 tmux modes × required-when-multiple paths × validation paths), not boilerplate. Helpers (`setupTestManager`, `setLinuxPlatform`, etc.) are shared by ~10 callers and consolidate per-test setup; collapsing them would inflate the file, not shrink it. Decision per the criterion: **keep, add top-of-file justification comment** — landed at the top of `internal/sandbox/setup_test.go` documenting the cross product and a "revisit if setup.go grows past ~350 lines" invariant.
