# Breaking Changes

Tracks breaking changes made during beta. Each entry should be included in release notes for the version that introduces it.

## Unreleased

### `yoloai new` no longer auto-attaches by default

**Previous behavior:** `yoloai new` auto-attached to the tmux session after creation. `--detach`/`-d` skipped the attach.

**New behavior:** `yoloai new` starts the sandbox in the background (detached). Use `--attach`/`-a` to auto-attach. `--detach`/`-d` is removed.

**Also applies to:** `yoloai start` now supports `--attach`/`-a` with the same semantics (detached by default).

**Rationale:** Consistent unix-y model — both `new` and `start` are detached by default, both accept `-a` to attach. Avoids confusing asymmetry where `new` used `-d` (detach) while `start` used `-a` (attach).

**Migration:** Replace `yoloai new ...` with `yoloai new -a ...` to restore the old default. Remove `-d`/`--detach` from any scripts.

### Tmux mouse mode no longer enabled by default

**Previous behavior:** Sandbox tmux sessions had `set -g mouse on`, enabling mouse-wheel scrolling, click-to-select-pane, and drag-to-resize. OSC 52 clipboard and `MouseDragEnd1Pane` bindings were configured to compensate for mouse mode breaking copy/paste.

**New behavior:** Mouse mode is off. Text selection and copy/paste work normally via the terminal. Scrollback is accessed with `^b [` (shown in the status bar). The OSC 52 and MouseDragEnd workarounds are removed.

**Rationale:** Mouse mode breaks copy/paste in many terminal emulators, and the clipboard workarounds (OSC 52, MouseDragEnd1Pane pipe-and-cancel) don't work reliably across all setups. Broken copy is worse UX than needing a keybinding to scroll.

**Migration:** If you prefer mouse mode, add `set -g mouse on` to your own `~/.tmux.conf` or a custom profile's tmux config.
