## Parallel Agent Workflows

Based on [parallel agents research](../research/parallel-agents.md).

### Batch sandbox creation

Add a `yoloai batch` command (or similar) that creates multiple sandboxes from a task list. Input could be a file with one prompt per line, a markdown file with structured specs, or inline arguments. Each task gets its own sandbox against the same workdir. All sandboxes start in parallel.

Example: `yoloai batch ./project tasks.md` creates N sandboxes, one per task in the file.

Design considerations:
- Naming: auto-generate names from task index or allow a prefix (`--prefix feat-`)
- Prompt delivery: each sandbox gets its task as `--prompt-file` or `--prompt`
- Options: inherit shared flags (agent, model, profile, aux dirs) from the batch command
- Output: summary table of created sandboxes

### Agent status detection

Detect whether the agent process inside a sandbox is actively running, idle (waiting for input), or has exited. Surface this in `yoloai ls` output.

Possible approaches:
- Monitor the agent process state (running vs. sleeping on stdin)
- Detect agent exit (process no longer running in the container)
- Use agent-specific hooks where available (e.g., Claude Code notification hooks)

Minimum viable: distinguish "agent running" from "agent exited" by checking if the agent process is still alive in the container.

### Sandbox chaining (pipelines)

Chain sandboxes sequentially so the output of one becomes the input of the next. Each stage runs an agent with its own prompt on the workdir as modified by prior stages.

Example: `yoloai chain ./project pipeline.yaml` runs stages in order, applying each stage's changes before starting the next.

Pipeline definition (YAML or similar) specifies an ordered list of stages, each with:
- Prompt or prompt file
- Agent and model (optional, inherit from defaults)
- Whether to pause for user review between stages (`--step` flag for interactive, default is unattended)

Data flow: stage N's workdir changes are applied (auto-apply) to produce stage N+1's starting state. Intermediate diffs are preserved for inspection. If a stage's agent exits with an error or the user rejects a stage's diff in `--step` mode, the pipeline stops.

Design considerations:
- Compose with batch: independent pipelines could run in parallel
- Resume: if a pipeline stops mid-way, allow resuming from the failed stage
- Naming: sandboxes could be named `<pipeline>-stage-1`, `<pipeline>-stage-2`, etc.
- Keep intermediate sandboxes around for inspection, or clean up on success (`--cleanup`)

### Enhanced `yoloai ls` dashboard

Enrich `yoloai ls` output for multi-sandbox workflows:
- Agent type and model
- Runtime duration (how long the sandbox has been running)
- Agent status (running/idle/exited)
- Workdir dirty state (has uncommitted changes)

Keep default output concise; add `--long` or `-l` flag for the full dashboard view.
