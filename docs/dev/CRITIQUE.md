# Critique: Bug Report and Structured Logging Design

Open questions from reviewing `docs/design/bugreport.md` from an implementer's perspective. Each item needs a design decision before implementation can proceed. Apply resolutions to `docs/design/bugreport.md` and clear this file when done.

---

## 1. `--bugreport` filename — chicken-and-egg with sandbox name

**Problem:** `--bugreport` fires in `PersistentPreRunE` on the root command, before any subcommand runs. The sandbox name (needed for `yoloai-bugreport-<name>-<timestamp>.md`) is determined by `resolveName()` inside each subcommand. At pre-run time, the name is not yet known.

**Options:**
- Parse `os.Args` directly in `PersistentPreRunE` to extract the name positional argument — fragile, couples pre-run to CLI structure.
- Open the temp file with a placeholder name; defer the final rename (with correct sandbox name) until after the command completes — loses the sandbox name in the filename if the command panics before the name is resolved.
- Drop the sandbox name from flag-mode filenames; always use `yoloai-bugreport-<timestamp>.md` — simpler, consistent with non-sandbox commands. Sandbox name already appears inside the report.
- Set a package-level variable in `PersistentPreRunE` that subcommands populate once they resolve the name; the finalizer uses it for the rename.

## 2. `sandbox.jsonl` — how does bash write JSONL?

**Problem:** `entrypoint.sh` is a bash script. Writing well-formed JSONL (correct timestamps, monotonic sequence numbers, JSON-escaped strings) from bash is non-trivial and error-prone. `jq` may not be available in all container images.

**Options:**
- `sandbox-setup.py` takes over all structured logging for the container side; `entrypoint.sh` only writes plain text to stdout (captured by Docker logs and a separate `entrypoint.log`). `sandbox.jsonl` is Python-only.
- Add a tiny logging helper binary that `entrypoint.sh` pipes to for JSONL output.
- Split the file: `entrypoint.log` (plain text, entrypoint.sh) and `sandbox.jsonl` (Python only, sandbox-setup.py).

**Recommendation to consider:** Splitting into two files is cleanest. Bash writing JSONL is fragile regardless of approach.

## 3. `seq` field — scope and Python restart handling

**Problem:** Two related questions about the `seq` field:

1. **Cross-file scope:** Are sequence numbers meaningful across `cli.jsonl` and `sandbox.jsonl` for interleaving, or per-file? If per-file, the interleaver must use `ts` as the primary sort key with `seq` as a tiebreaker within the same file only.

2. **Python restarts:** If `status-monitor.py` is restarted, how does it resume the sequence number? Read the last line of `monitor.jsonl` on startup? Start from 0 per-session?

## 4. `agent-hooks.jsonl` — required hook script changes

**Problem:** Agent hooks currently write `{"status":"idle"}` to `agent-status.json` (overwrite). The design adds `agent-hooks.jsonl` as an append-only log but doesn't specify:

- The JSONL schema for hook entries
- Whether hooks write to `agent-hooks.jsonl` in addition to `agent-status.json`, or instead of
- Whether this is a yoloai-side change (yoloai installs the hook scripts) or requires agent-side changes
- How hooks know the path to `agent-hooks.jsonl`

---

## 5. `runtime-config.json` field omission in `safe` mode

**Problem:** The doc says `setup_commands` and `allowed_domains` are "omitted" in `safe` mode. The YAML sanitizer is line-by-line with no parser dependency — but JSON field omission without a parser is fragile (multiline values, nested structures, varied whitespace).

**Options:**
- Use a JSON parser to read, delete fields, and re-serialize — correct but adds parser dependency (though Go's `encoding/json` is stdlib).
- Include `runtime-config.json` as-is and rely on pattern scanning to catch sensitive values.
- Omit `runtime-config.json` entirely from `safe` mode.

---

## 6. `--debug` reaching container processes — timing issue

**Problem:** The doc says `--debug` enables debug-level entries in `sandbox.jsonl` and `monitor.jsonl`. These are Python processes inside the container that read their debug flag from `runtime-config.json` at startup. But `runtime-config.json` is written at container creation time.

**Timing issue:** `yoloai --debug start x` — the container already exists, `runtime-config.json` is already written with whatever `debug` value was set at `new` time. Does `--debug` on `start` affect container-side logging at all, or only the CLI's own `cli.jsonl` output?

---

## 7. JSONL interleaving algorithm and `--follow`

**Problem:** `sandbox <name> log` interleaves four JSONL files by timestamp. The algorithm is unspecified for the `--follow` case in particular:

- **Static:** Read all four files, merge-sort by `ts`, emit. Straightforward.
- **`--follow`:** Tail all four files simultaneously and merge in real-time. A goroutine-per-file with channel merge is the natural Go approach, but polling interval and latency characteristics need specifying.

---

## 9. `sandbox.jsonl` event type taxonomy

**Problem:** Section 8 filters entries by event type (e.g. `entrypoint.setup_cmd`, `entrypoint.network.*`) for `safe` mode. But there is no complete list of event types that `sandbox.jsonl` will emit.

An implementer writing the Python/bash side needs the full taxonomy upfront to know what to emit. An implementer writing the `safe`-mode filter needs the complete list to know what to omit.

---

## 11. ANSI stripping sufficiency for `agent.log`

**Problem:** `agent.log` is a raw terminal recording containing not just SGR color codes but full VT100 sequences: cursor positioning (`[180C[1A`), terminal mode switches (`[?2004l`, `[?2026h`), terminal identification queries (`>0q`, `[c`), bracketed paste, window title sequences. The existing `stripANSI` from `ansi.go` handles SGR codes — it may leave significant noise from these other sequences, producing largely unreadable output for `--agent` mode.

**Options:**
- Use a more comprehensive VT100 stripping library.
- Accept best-effort readability and document the limitation.
- Use `tmux capture-pane -p` for the stripped view (renders to plain text) instead of `agent.log` — but only works on live sessions.
