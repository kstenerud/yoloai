# Discovered Findings

Findings that turned up mid-workstream (architecture-remediation, layering-refactor, or any future plan) and were **not** in the originating audit. Per the discovered-findings policy:

- **Critical findings escalate immediately, do not park.** Critical = observable data loss, security issues, observable regressions in shipped behavior, or anything that would block the current release.
- **Everything else parks here** until the next re-audit checkpoint. Don't expand a workstream's scope to absorb new findings.
- The discoverer makes the severity call; when uncertain, escalate.
