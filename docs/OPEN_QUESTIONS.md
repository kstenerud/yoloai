# Open Questions

Questions encountered during design and implementation that need resolution. Resolve each before the relevant implementation phase begins.

## Pre-Implementation (resolve before coding starts)

1. ~~**Go module path**~~ — **Resolved:** `github.com/kstenerud/yoloai`.

2. ~~**Node.js version**~~ — **Resolved:** Node.js 20 LTS via NodeSource. Anthropic's own devcontainer uses Node 20 + npm install. The native Claude Code installer (curl script) is not suitable: bundles Bun with broken proxy support (issue #14165), segfaults on Debian bookworm AMD64 (#12044), and auto-updates. npm install shows a deprecation warning but remains the only reliable path for Docker/proxy use. See RESEARCH.md "Claude Code Installation Research".

3. ~~**tini**~~ — **Resolved:** Use `docker run --init` (Docker's built-in tini). Simpler than installing in image. We control all container creation in code so the flag is always passed.

4. ~~**gosu**~~ — **Resolved:** Install from GitHub releases (static binary). Standard for Debian images.

5. ~~**Claude ready indicator**~~ — **Resolved:** Fixed 3-second delay for MVP, configurable via `YOLOAI_STARTUP_DELAY`. Polling deferred.

6. ~~**Caret encoding scope**~~ — **Resolved:** Implement the full caret encoding spec. Trivial to implement and avoids platform-specific assumptions.

## Deferred Items Worth Reconsidering

These were deferred from MVP but might be cheap to add and valuable for dogfooding:

7. ~~**`--model` flag**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Trivial pass-through to agent command.

8. ~~**`yoloai exec`**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Simple `docker exec` wrapper, useful for debugging.

9. ~~**Dangerous directory detection**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Small validation function.

10. ~~**Dirty git repo warning**~~ — **Resolved:** Include in MVP. Small git status check.

## Post-MVP (resolve before relevant feature is implemented)

11. **Codex proxy support** — Whether Codex's static Rust binary honors `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars is unverified (DESIGN.md line 340, RESEARCH.md). Critical for `--network-isolated` mode with Codex. If it ignores proxy env vars, would need iptables-only enforcement.

12. **Codex required network domains** — Only `api.openai.com` is confirmed (DESIGN.md line 341/445). Additional domains (telemetry, model downloads) may be required.

13. **Codex TUI behavior in tmux** — Interactive mode (`codex --yolo` without `exec`) behavior in tmux is unverified (RESEARCH.md).

14. **Image cleanup mechanism** — Docker images accumulate indefinitely. Cleanup is deferred pending research into Docker's image lifecycle (DESIGN.md line 642). Needs design for safe pruning that doesn't break running sandboxes.
